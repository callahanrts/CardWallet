Card Wallet
=========

Card Wallet is an iPhone application aimed at solving the problem of owning too many gift cards. With Card Wallet, you can scan all gift cards that have bar codes or you can enter the data manually. The application will then generate a bar code that can be used at the store. The end result is a wallet that is not stuffed with gift cards.
